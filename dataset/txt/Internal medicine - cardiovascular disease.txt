Internal Medicine is a discipline that studies the occurrence, development, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of diseases. The Cardiovascular System, one of its most important components, is a compulsory course for medical students of different types and years of schooling. This course introduces common diseases and frequently-occurring diseases of the cardiovascular system so that medical students can learn from the shallow to the deep, especially by combining offline study and self-study, to cultivate their autonomous learning and logical thinking ability, understand and master the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases, thus truly applying what they have learned to clinical practice.
Mainly aiming for medical undergraduates, this course will expand the basic knowledge they have mastered and improve their learning efficiency by integrating clinical cases, animation demonstrations and other methods. At the same time, the professors teaching online will broaden and update students’ knowledge by offline discussions and assessments to improve teaching quality.
