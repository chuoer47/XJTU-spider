This course aims to offer learners a comparatively panoramic survey of English public speaking, elaborating and practicing the fundamental skills of an orator, by covering the formats and skills of basic genres of English public speaking (mainly informative speech, persuasive speech, and impromptu speech). The course also helps the learners to improve their critical thinking skills and cross-cultural communication awareness.
Public speaking is so important that it could be the deciding factor in the academic arena, career development, and business growth etc. Hopefully, learners can also broaden their visions and culture related domains by extensive reading and active participation in the unit discussions and interactions with the teachers and other learners of the course.
