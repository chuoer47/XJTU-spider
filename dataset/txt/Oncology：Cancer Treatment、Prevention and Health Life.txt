Everyone may have had such an experience - his or her relatives, friends, or colleagues unfortunately develop a cancer. Their first response may be “How could they have cancer without obvious pathogenic triggers. Then in the treatment process, they are hesitant about various treatment alternatives. They repeatedly turn to the network, acquaintances, friends, and friends of friends, for treatment options.
Faced with this situation, anyone who lacks cancer-related knowledge will be caught in a dilemma. In the meanwhile, we are surrounded with patchy knowledge of health preservation and health care from the media, of which many send wrong messages to the public. It is necessary to provide scientific and correct knowledge and information of cancer for the masses and students in and outside school. Therefore, the course Oncology: Cancer Prevention & Treatment and Healthy Life comes into being. The traditional teaching method is relatively dreary, because the content of Oncology is complex involving various systems of the body. Now, based on the logic of disease prevention and treatment, we divide and recombine the knowledge points, designing a new teaching system.
The course Oncology: Cancer Prevention & Treatment and Healthy Life went online on MOOC soon in 2020. Hope you will join us in learning about high-risk factors, prevention and treatment of cancers, and a healthy lifestyle. Let us fight cancers together, take scientific prevention and treatment, and live a healthy life!
Wish all of you happiness and good health!
