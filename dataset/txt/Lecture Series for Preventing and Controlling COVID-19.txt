Since December 2019, patients with pneumonia of unknown causes have been found in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. All levels of government and health administrative departments attach great importance to it and promptly organize disease control institutions, medical units and scientific research institutes to carry out investigation, treatment and collaborative research. The pathogen of this type of cases has been rapidly identified as novel coronavirus. The World Health Organization (WHO) has confirmed and named it 2019-nCoV. Pneumonia caused by this pathogen infection is called pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus infection. Under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council with Xi Jinping at the core, China has mobilized and fully deployed the epidemic prevention and control work as the most important work, and the spread of the virus in the country has been controlled effectively. With the spread and spread of the new crown virus in the world, the epidemic has long been China's own affair, and has become a global epidemic requiring cooperation and control from all countries in the world. The "reverse" of the epidemic urgently needs to set up a MOOC course on pneumonia in novel coronavirus, so that overseas students, graduate students and social people in the world can correctly understand the epidemic and lay a foundation for the global fight against the epidemic.
