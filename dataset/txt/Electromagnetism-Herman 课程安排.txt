Electromagnetism: ParadoxesInstructorHerman BatelaanEmail: hbatelaan2@unl.edu
DescriptionDeep comprehension of electromagnetism is important for further studies in quantum mechanics, field theory and optics. Nevertheless, electromagnetism by itself is often presented as a technique to be mastered without much intrinsic interest. We will revisit classical electromagnetism by identifying interesting problems and studying paradoxes. Perhaps surprisingly, there are some open problems in this classical field of physics. Why have we not been able to observe the effect of gravity on electromagnetism in the laboratory? What is the resolution of Feynman’s paradox and does that mean that Newton’s third law can be broken? What should we know about magnetic monopoles? Such questions will be addressed in this lecture series. It is assumed that the student will have had an undergraduate level course in electromagnetism. The basic level electromagnetism required for the comprehension of the paradoxes will be reviewed each day before introducing the paradox.
