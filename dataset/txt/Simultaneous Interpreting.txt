The course aims at developing the students' basic skills of simultaneous interpreting through training in shadowing, text analysis, segmentation, de-verbalization, dual-audio processing, chunking, the linear approach to text, anticipation and other coping tactics. Sight translation will be learnt both as a skill and a transitional activity to simultaneous interpreting. Topics cover education, diplomacy, international trade, environmental protection, cultural exchange and technology. The course introduces students the practice and process of simultaneous interpreting at the fundamental level.
The course will enhance students' abilities of splitting attention in a multi-tasking situation and their coordination skills needed for accomplishing such tasks. Students will develop these skills by completing varieties of interpreting tasks through individual performance, peer reviews and unit discussions. Meanwhile, it intends to help students get familiar with the elements and operation in simultaneous interpretation, as well as the working properties and career ethics of a professional conference interpreter. Learners will also be introduced to the SI technical equipment, familiarize themselves with its operations and practice booth etiquette.
Hopefully, learners can also broaden their visions and culture related domains by extensive background information reading and active on-line participation in the unit discussions and interactions with the teachers and other learners of the course.
